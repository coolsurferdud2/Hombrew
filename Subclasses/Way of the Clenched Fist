Way of The Clenched Fist

Practiced Hands
Years of training have allowed you to stay at the brink without releasing for days, months and for a few trained experts, years. Gain proficiency in sleight of hand if you did not already have it. 

Clenched Style
At 3rd level every clenched fist monk has to make the difficult decision to edge or goon. Pick either edging or gooning to use. You can choose to change to a different one at 6th, 11th and 17th level.

  Edging Style
  At 3rd level, if you reduce a creature to 1HP each subsequent non-lethal attack increases the creatures goon level (GL) by 1. You can spend 1 ki point on a creature with 1HP to make an enemy bust. Busting kills the enemy and sends a 5ft wide 5ft*GL long line in a direction of the monks choosing. Any creatures hit by the line have to make a DEX saving throw if they succeed they only take half damage. The line deals the monks damage die*GL.

  Gooning Style
  At 3th level you learn to keep yourself on the edge even during combat. You can choose to start gooning in combat as a free action. Whilst gooning your AC increases by 3 at 6th level, 4 at 9th level, 5 at 13th level, and 6 at 17th level. Any attack that misses you gives you 1 goon level. The next time you are hit the hit is a critical hit and you bust without dealing any damage to yourself. Busting sends a 5ft wide 5ft*GL long line in a direction of the monks choosing. Any creatures hit by the line have to make a DEX saving throw if they succeed they only take half damage. The line deals the monks damage die*GL.

Grip Strength
At 6th level you can choose to make a death save to treat your damage dice as dealing maximum damage. If you roll a 1 you get two negative death saves. If you roll a 2 to a 19 you gain 1 death save. If you roll a 20 you get no negative death saves.

The Edge of Death
At 11th level you can add your number of negative death saves to your attack and damage rolls.

Goon Mastery
At 17th level all goon levels are applied twice.
