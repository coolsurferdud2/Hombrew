Living Missile:
At 3rd level after long jumping at an enemy you can make a melee attack that deals xd4 force damage on impact where x = (distance traveled/5). 

Improved Thrusters:
At 7th level you gain an additional 30ft of movement that can only be used for jump distance. This increases to 60 at 15th level. Additionally you can triple your jump distance.

Stronger Payload: 
At 10th level your human missile now deals xd6 damage and you can make any creature within 10ft of your attack take additional damage equal to half the damage dealt to your initial target.

Chemtrails:
At 15th level you leave chemtrails. Whenever you make a jump leave a trail that damages any creatures who enter it for 3d6 fire damage. These trails last until the beginning of your next turn.

ICBM:
At 18th level you become an intercontinental balistic missile. You can now make your human missile melee attack as part of your jump and can make it from a high jump. Additionally if landing on another creature the DC for the dex save is increased to 25.
Additionally when landing on someone if they pass the save they take half the damage and if they fail they take all the damage.
